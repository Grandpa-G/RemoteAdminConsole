# Remote Admin Console#
This tool provides a method to remotely control many operational aspects of at TShock (Terraria) server. The tool is based upon REST API extensions and operates by using a standalone Windows program.

An extension (dll) is required to augment the existing REST API functions to provide a more robust set of capabilities used to manage the server. The dll must be placed in the plugin folder similar to all other TShock plugins.

The RESTAPI funtionality must be turned on through the use of a configuration option.
